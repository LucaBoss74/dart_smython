Smython for Dart
================

A tiny incomplete interpreter for a language similar to Python 3 with enough
functionality to parse & interpret the factorial and the fibonacci function.

This has been hacked together based on a similar interpreter I did some
ten years ago, that time for [Objective-C](https://github.com/sma/Pyphon)
and [Java](https://github.com/sma/smython3).

## Running the Code

To run the included test suite, execute `dart pub get` once and then simply
execute `dart run`. If should print `OK` for all code snippets.
